VALIDATE DATA BEFORE SEARCHING FOR SOLUTION IN IT
//means check all assupmtions made before 
//duplicate link / room
//start and end has at least one links
//stop at first empty line or double \n
//if char command has more than 1 bit set == ERROR //start and end on a different room
//if Start has End as neighbour == ERROR

//optimize search for max theorc flow
	//count neighbours of start and end 
		//min of neighbours is theorique max flow
			// nbr path nescessaire = min ( max flow || nbr ant)

//need to print spaces only if necessary (last move no space before \n)

//final clean

PATH ROUTINE IN BFS to calculate
	if (new bfs lowers number of turn)
		use new set of paths
	else
		keep old one
so get paths, sort paths, split ants in EK

and move paths after EK returns;

###BEGIN OF INPUT###

lines that start with '#' are comments

##LINES RULES##
empty lines are forbidden

##ROOM RULES##
name cannot start with 'L' or '#'
Coordinates must be integers

this implies:
at most 2 spaces in room lines "RoomName COOR_X" and"COOR_X COOR_Y"

##COMMANDS RUES##
lines that start with "##" are commands
only "start" and "end" are recognized commands
other commands are ignored (not an error treated as comments)

##LINK RULES##
lines are as follows:
RoomName1-RoomName2

###END OF INPUT###

###BEGIN OF OUTPUT###

LAnt#1-Room#1 
LAnt#2-Room#1 LAnt1-Room#2
.

LAnt#max-End
