//means check all assupmtions made before 
//duplicate link / room
//start and end has at least one links
//stop at first empty line or double \n
//if char command has more than 1 bit set == ERROR //start and end on a different room
//if Start has End as neighbour == ERROR

//optimize search for max theorc flow
	//count neighbours of start and end 
		//min of neighbours is theorique max flow
			// nbr path nescessaire = min ( max flow || nbr ant)

//need to print spaces only if necessary (last move no space before \n)
