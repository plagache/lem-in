VALIDATE DATA BEFORE SEARCHING FOR SOLUTION IN IT
//means check all assupmtions made before 
//duplicate link 
//start and end has at least one links
//stop at first empty line or double \n
//
//if char command has more than 1 bit set == ERROR //start and end on a different room
//if Start has End as neighbour == ERROR
//delete room if dead end

augmented path
// we do not have max flow
// flow in ; flow out 

modify BFS to take flow and not capacity and finish at END

clean
//free list
//free content

ants display
//path repartition
//display turn :
				- create ant move
				- join move
				- 
//final clean


DEBUGGING
